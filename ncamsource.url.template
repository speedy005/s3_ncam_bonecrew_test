#Save this file as ncamsource.url to influence the source(s)
#from which the ncam-git repository is cloned from

### STANDARD NCAM REPOSITORY ###
#   To change the standard ncam repository, uncomment
#   the line starting with #trunkurl and point it
#   to a different location.
#
#trunkurl="https://domain/own-repo.git"

### CUSTOM NCAM REPOSITORY IDENTIFIERS ###
#   To flexible switch the ncam repository, uncomment
#   the lines starting with #*IDENT, #*FOO, #*BAR and
#   point it to locations of your choice.
#
#   You can change the INDENT part of the trunkurlIDENT
#   variable according to your needs and it is possible
#   to configure multiple custom identifiers (see FOO, BAR).
#
#   To have s3 use one of the defined identifier URLs,
#   simply add SOURCE=IDENT before the s3 commands.
#
#   command: SOURCE=IDENT ./s3 checkout
#trunkurlIDENT="https://domain/ident-repo.git"
#
#   command: SOURCE=FOO ./s3 menu
#trunkurlFOO="https://domain/foo-repo.git"
#
#   command: SOURCE=BAR ./s3 repoup
#trunkurlBAR="https://domain/bar-repo.git"
